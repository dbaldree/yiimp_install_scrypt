# The following customisations where necessary for a fork of BITCOIN v0.20.
## this is due to RPC changes and Segwit activation.
**Important:**  
Bitcoin core and any forked coins using v0.18+ must run xxxxcoind with -addresstype=legacy switch.  
Mining with BECH32 segwit addresses is not yet possible you must generate a legacy address for the pool to use.  
You do not need to run â€“deprecatedrpc=accounts.
